1. Add the tool chain to your path; ie export PATH=$PATH:~gcc/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3/bin$
2. All examples, i.e apps are in the apps/ directory

building an application
cd app/helloworld

make

3. The make file will create an obj directory with all of the objs for the project and elf, and bin in the current directory.
4. make clean will delete everything.
